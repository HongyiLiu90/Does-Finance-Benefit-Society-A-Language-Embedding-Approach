Title: Does Finance Benefit Society? A Language Embedding Approach
Authors: Manish Jha, Hongyi Liu, and Asaf Manela
Journal: Review of Financial Studies (forthcoming)

Summary:

This paper presents a novel measure of finance sentiment using language embedding models, specifically BERT, to analyze the portrayal of finance across millions of books published in eight countries from 1870 to 2009. We developed a “Finance Sentiment Index” to capture whether finance-related content is expressed positively or negatively. Main findings include:

	1.	Persistence in National Sentiments: Finance sentiment varies significantly across countries, with more capitalist societies generally showing positive sentiment and countries with socialist histories showing negative sentiment.
	2.	Predictive Power: A decline in finance sentiment often precedes financial crises by one year, suggesting that negative public perception may foreshadow economic downturns. Positive shifts in sentiment are correlated with higher future GDP and credit growth, underscoring finance’s potential societal benefits when public trust is strong.
	3.	Correlations with Economic Indicators: Finance sentiment correlates positively with financial market participation and negatively with income inequality, reinforcing its economic relevance.

In addition, our application contributes to understanding public perception of finance over time and across cultural contexts and highlights the influence of sentiment on financial crises, and macroeconomic stability and growth.
